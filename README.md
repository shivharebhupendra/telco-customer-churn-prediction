# telco-customer-churn-prediction
End-to-end machine learning project to predict customer churn for a telecom company using Python, EDA, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.

# 📊 Telco Customer Churn Prediction (End-to-End ML Project)

This is a complete machine learning project to predict customer churn in a telecom company. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to discontinue services based on usage patterns and demographic information.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Customer churn is a major concern for subscription-based businesses. Retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project aims to build a predictive model that accurately identifies customers likely to churn, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## 🧪 Step-by-Step Pipeline

### 📌 01. Data Loading & EDA
- Loaded the dataset and removed unnecessary columns (`customerID`)
- Explored data distributions, outliers, and correlations
- Visualized churn rate by various features

### 📌 02. Feature Engineering & Preprocessing
- Converted `TotalCharges` to numeric
- Encoded binary variables using `.map()` and multi-class with `get_dummies()`
- Scaled numerical features
- Created new features like:
  - `TotalServices` (count of services)
  - `AvgMonthlySpend`
  - `TenureGroup` (grouped customer loyalty)

### 📌 03. Modeling & Evaluation
- Trained Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers
- Handled class imbalance using `class_weight='balanced'`
- Used `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluated models using:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC-AUC Curve

## 📈 Model Performance (Post-Tuning)

| Model                | Accuracy | Precision (Churn) | Recall (Churn) | F1-Score | ROC-AUC |
|---------------------|----------|-------------------|----------------|----------|---------|
| Logistic Regression | 72%      | 0.49              | 79%            | 0.61     | **0.84** |
| Random Forest       | 76%      | 0.54              | 75%            | 0.63     | **0.82** |

## 🔍 Feature Importance

- **Top Influential Features**:
  - `Contract_Two year`
  - `MonthlyCharges`
  - `tenure`
  - `TechSupport_Yes`
  - `InternetService_Fiber optic`
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest both confirm these patterns.
